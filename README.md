# Image-Segmentation-By-Geometric-Partial-Differential-Equation
This is the short review of image segmentation using geometric partial differential equations, and its mathematical background. In fact, this idea is divided into "Direct Method" and "Indirect Method". This paper includes explanations about each concept and my improvement.

The overview of may paper is shown as the first attatchment.

The index of my paper is as follows. 
The first chapter is a introduction. 
The second one is the preliminary part. 
The third part is about the detail of direct method and its mathematics. My original area is around there, so I will go deeply into it.
The final part is thier application to image segmentation, which are implemented by Matlab. If you have no time to follow the rigrous mathematics, please move on to this part at first.
